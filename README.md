# MLSS 2016

This is the code we used for the tutorial session about networks learning in
MLSS-2016. The tutorial is based on the NetRate algorithm described here:

> M. Gomez-Rodriguez, D. Balduzzi, B. Sch√∂lkopf. Uncovering the Temporal Dynamics of Diffusion Networks. The 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011.

## Generation 

The generation code is written in Python 3.

### Requirements

The requirements for data generation are in `requirements.txt`.

### Graph

The script `generate-graph.py` can be used to generate a graph file as well as
the solution `A` matrix. Run `generate-graph.py -h` to see all supported options.

The script `csv2dot.sh` can be used on Unix-like systems to convert the graph
to a dot file which can be visualized using GraphViz.

### Cascade

The script `run_cascade.py` uses the graph generated in the previous step to
generate the cascade. Run `run_cascade.py -h` to see all the supported options.

## Inference

The inference code, unless explicitly stated, reads the input from
`cascades.csv`, assume that the time period of the cascades was `1.0` and
that there are `50` nodes in the graph.

### Python

`solve_cascade.py` uses CVX to solve the NetRate problem. 
`solve_cascade_no_cvx.py` solves the problem using the L-BFGS-B algorithm.

`utils.py` contains code which can be used to calculate the performance
of the solutions.

#### Requirements
  
  - cvxpy
  - scipy

### MATLAB

`solve_cascade.m` uses CVX to solve the NetRate problem.
`calc_score.m` defines the function which can calculate the performance.

#### Requirements

  - CVX

### Julia

**TODO**

### Lua

**TODO**
